# Naruto-Shippuden

There is no doubt that most  of our childhood was spent watching anime especially Naruto, we have seen and experienced it all. With Hacktoberfest 2021 coming up and being one of the people who would participate for the very first time, I decided to create this repository that's actually a very basic web-page that let the user view and add their favourite characters.

You can find all types characters on https://www.giantbomb.com/naruto-uzumaki/3005-790/friends/ and on https://www.giantbomb.com/naruto-uzumaki/3005-790/enemies/

1. index.html - Contains the content of the main/home page.
2. index.css -  Contains the styling given to the  home page.

# But what if i don't know how to add cards :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card!

Code - 

               <!-- card end-->
               <div class="card mb-3 card-bg my-4" style="max-width: 100%;">
                  <div class="row no-gutters">
                      <div class="col-md-4">
                         <img src=[image-link] alt=[name of character] height="390px" width="300px">  
                      </div>
                  <div class="col-md-8">
                     <div class="card-body">
                        <h2 class="card-title">[name of character]</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">[Main description about character]</p>
                        <p>[some more description about character]</p>
                    </div>
                 </div>
               </div>
             </div>
           <!--card end-->

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Try and test it on your own system and then create a Pull request. You can adjust height of image of character so that it will fit in card.
